Tools and Libraries Used
This script utilizes several powerful Python libraries to automate data analysis and reporting:
1.	Pandas:
o	Used for reading and processing data from a CSV file.
o	Enables easy computation of statistics like average, maximum, and minimum scores.
o	Also helps in selecting specific rows and values from the dataset.
2.	Matplotlib:
o	A popular data visualization library used to create the pie chart that visually represents score distribution among students.
o	The chart is saved as an image and later embedded into the PDF report.
3.	ReportLab:
o	A PDF generation library used to create multi-page reports.
o	Supports adding text, formatting fonts, and inserting images into the PDF.
o	Ideal for producing professional-grade documents programmatically.
4.	OS (Operating System):
o	Used for file operations like removing the temporary image file (pie_chart.png) after it has been added to the PDF.
These tools work together seamlessly to transform raw data into a well-structured, formatted PDF report.

üíª Editor / Development Platform
This script can be developed and run using various Python development environments:
‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook (part of Anaconda):
o	Great for step-by-step execution and seeing visual output inline.
o	Ideal for data science workflows and experimenting with different visuals.
‚Ä¢	VS Code (Visual Studio Code):
o	Popular, lightweight code editor with Python support and terminal integration.
o	Suitable for scripting and PDF generation tasks.
‚Ä¢	Google Colab:
o	A cloud-based Jupyter-like environment that allows you to run Python code in a browser.
o	Although downloading PDFs and managing local files might need tweaks here.
‚Ä¢	PyCharm:
o	A full-featured IDE ideal for structured Python projects, especially when working with external libraries like ReportLab.
You can choose any of the above based on your comfort and whether you prefer local or cloud-based environments.
